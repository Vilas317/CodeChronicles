<!-- Write internal CSS to make the features section responsive

You are given HTML and some preset CSS as boilerplate.
In HTML:
1. section.features contains:
1.1. h1 element
1.2. div.container-parent
2. div.container-parent contains: (display set as flex)
2.2. 3 div.containter elements that are the feature cards.
To achieve this you need to utilise media query in the following manner.

Add a media query for screens smaller than 940px, in which:
1. Using flex-direction, change the main-axis of the div.container-parent to y-axis
2. In the div.container-parent, align the items across cross-axis to center.

Note: smaller than 940px will have max-width set to 939px

Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.
Verify that a Media query for screens smaller than 940px (max-width: 939px) is written.
Verify that in that media query, div.container-parent has main-axis change to y-axis
Verify that in that media query, div.container-parent has items across the cross-axis aligned to center -->
